# Drug Lord Game

The Drug Lord Game was a game I used to play in a Texas Ti-83 calculator. It was a super simple and random game, where the player had 10 days to buy and sell drugs and make the most money.

I want to replicate part of this game using Grakn as a database and flask as an API. Maybe later learn some front-end stuff.

Anyway here is the plan:

1. Design City class
2. Place cities in Grakn
3. Design Player class
4. Place players in Grakn
5. Ability for players to move around.
6. ... think about the rest ...
