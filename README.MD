# Drug Lord Game

The Drug Lord Game was a game I used to play in a Texas Ti-83 calculator. It was a super simple and random game, where the player had 10 days to buy and sell drugs and make the most money.

I want to replicate part of this game using Postgres as a database and django. Maybe later learn some front-end stuff.
